# News Dashboard - Front End

## Description

The titular 'News Dashboard', this React frontend displays news summary
information retrieved from the Headline API.

## Build

The frontend can be built by following these steps after getting the code:

1. **Install Dependencies:** Install the front end's dependencies:

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

2. **Build**: Run the following script, which itself uses vite, to build the
frontend:

    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```

## Future Improvements

I have several ideas for future additions to make to the frontend:

- I'd like to add the  ability for users to click words in the wordcloud and
see a list of all the headlines containing that word which were used to build
the cloud
- I'd also like to add a button that users can click to donwload the wordcloud
as a png
