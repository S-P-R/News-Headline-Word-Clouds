# News Dashboard

## Description
A full-stack news dashboard with 3 components *(links are to dedicated READMEs)*:

1. [**Web Scraper**](scraper/README.md): A web scraper that scrapes news headlines from the front page of several different news sources and places them into a
Postgres database. Written in Python

2. [**News Headline API**](backend/README.md): A RESTful API that allows users to retrieve headline information. Created with Flask

3. [**Front End**](frontend/README.md): The News Dashboard itself - a single-page application that displays
news summary information. Made with React
